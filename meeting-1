Github conflict:
* Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.


* Tip: You can use the conflict editor on GitHub to resolve competing line change merge conflicts between branches that are part of a pull request.[solve merge conflict](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-merge-conflicts)

Coding Standard:
* Coding Standards for Components: It is recommended to write components name by its purpose. This approach 
  improves the readability and maintainability of code.

* Coding Standards for Classes: Usually class name should be noun starting with uppercase letter. If it contains 
  multiple word than every inner word should start with uppercase.

  Eg: String, StringBuffer, Dog

* Coding Standards for Interface: Usually interface name should be adjective starting with uppercase letter. If 
 it contains multiple word than every inner word should start with uppercase.

 Eg: Runnable, Serializable, Comparable

* Coding Standards for Methods: Usually method name should either be verb or verb noun combination starting with 
  lower letter. If it contains multiple word than every inner word should start with uppercase.

  Eg: print(), sleep(), setSalary()

* Coding Standards for Variables: Usually variable name should be noun starting with lowercase letter. If it 
  contains multiple word than every inner word should start with uppercase.

  Eg: name, age. mobileNumber

* Coding Standards for Constants: Usually constant name should be noun. It should contain only uppercase If it 
  contains multiple word than words are separated with ( _ ) underscore symbol. Usually we declare constants 
  with public static and final modifiers.

* Java Bean Coding Standards: A Java Bean is a simple java class with private properties and public getter and 
   setter methods

Getter Methods:

It should be public method
Method name should be prefixed with “get”
It should not take any argument
Setter Methods:

It should be public method
Return Type should be void
Method name should be prefixed with “set”
It should take some argument
public class StudentBean{

   private String name;

   public void setName(String name){

   this.name=name;

  }

  public String getName(){

  return name;

  }

}

Note: For boolean properties getter method can be prefixed with “get” or “is”

* Coding convention for Listners:

To register a Listner method name should prefixed with add
Eg: public void addMyAccountListner( MyActionListner);

To unregister a Listner method name should prefixed with remove
Eg: public void removeMyAccountListner( MyActionListner);
