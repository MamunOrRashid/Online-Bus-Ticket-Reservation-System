NUnit:
 Advantage:
	-fast
	-test isolation
	-environment isolation - use Mock  Objects
	-unit testing gives you a safety net when programmers refactor or add functionality
	-unit tests can be used as documentation for other programmers
	-Development process becomes more flexible.
 Disadvantage:
	-Unnecessary Unit Tests can lead to considerably high maintenance cost to your overall project.


JUnit:
 Advantage:
	-Programmers become more productive
	-Increase the Quality of the developed code.
	- Easily run regression tests, i.e. run your tests again and again.
	-You could write the tests before writing the code.
	-Can be composed into a hierarchy of test suits.
 Disadvantage:
	-JUnit has disadvantages in different testing areas, a major one being that it can only run tests on one JVM (Java virtual machine).


TestNG:
 Advantage:
	-It gives the facility to produce HTML Reports of implementation.
	-Annotation have made testers life easier.
	-Test case can be Prioritized and Grouped more easily.
	-It makes Parallel testing easier.
	-Logs can be generated.
	-It makes Data Parameterization possible.
 Disadvantage: 
	-simple

PHPUnit:
 Advantage:
	-Your code coverage should more accurately show code that was actually tested.
 Disadvantage:
	-The risks is that sometimes a test is meant to test multiple functions and it would require having multiple @covers annotations
	-if you change the method or function name and don't update the @covers annotation, then your code coverage won't cover the function or method you actually tested.
 
Emma
 Advantages:
       •EMMA is an open-source toolkit for analyzing and reporting code written in Java language.
       •Emma support coverage types like method, line, basic block.
       •It is Java-based so it is without external library dependencies and can access the source code.

JTest
 Advantages:
       •JTest is Unit Testing solution developed and designed by Parasoft
       •It is highly used for testing Java application and supports static code analysis
       •It also includes data flow static analysis, metrics analysis, run-time error detection etc.
       •JTest also performs regression testing, end-to-end functional and load testing for complex application
       •It helps to capture actual code behavior and generates JUnit tests for coverage analysis.

Mockito
 Advantages
       •No need to write mock objects on your own.
       •Renaming interface method names or reordering parameters will not break the test code as Mocks are created at runtime.
       •Supports return values.
       •Supports exceptions.
       •Supports check on order of method calls.
       •Supports creating mocks using annotation.
 Disadvantages:
       •Cannot mock final classes
       •Cannot mock final methods - their real behavior is executed without any exception. Mockito cannot warn you about mocking final methods so be vigilant.
       •Cannot mock static methods
       •Cannot mock constructors
