## xUnit.net:
   * Advantage:
        1. It Free, open source, community-focused unit testing tool for the .NET Framework
        2. These frameworks derive their structure and functionality from Smalltalk’s SUnit. Following its introduction in Smalltalk, the framework was ported to Java and it gained wide popularity
        3. Works with CodeRush, TestDriven.NET, ReSharper and Xamarin.
   * Disadvantage:
        1. XUnit does not appear to have explicit built-in support for external data source-based testing.
