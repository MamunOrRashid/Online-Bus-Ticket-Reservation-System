NUnit:
 Advantage:
	-fast
	-test isolation
	-environment isolation - use Mock  Objects
	-unit testing gives you a safety net when programmers refactor or add functionality
	-unit tests can be used as documentation for other programmers
	-Development process becomes more flexible.
 Disadvantage:
	-Unnecessary Unit Tests can lead to considerably high maintenance cost to your overall project.


JUnit:
 Advantage:
	-Programmers become more productive
	-Increase the Quality of the developed code.
	- Easily run regression tests, i.e. run your tests again and again.
	-You could write the tests before writing the code.
	-Can be composed into a hierarchy of test suits.
 Disadvantage:
	-JUnit has disadvantages in different testing areas, a major one being that it can only run tests on one JVM (Java virtual machine).


TestNG:
 Advantage:
	-It gives the facility to produce HTML Reports of implementation.
	-Annotation have made testers life easier.
	-Test case can be Prioritized and Grouped more easily.
	-It makes Parallel testing easier.
	-Logs can be generated.
	-It makes Data Parameterization possible.
 Disadvantage: 
	-simple

PHPUnit:
 Advantage:
	-Your code coverage should more accurately show code that was actually tested.
 Disadvantage:
	-The risks is that sometimes a test is meant to test multiple functions and it would require having multiple @covers annotations
	-if you change the method or function name and don't update the @covers annotation, then your code coverage won't cover the function or method you actually tested.
